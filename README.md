### Why should you download it?
There are numerous cool languages out there whose syntaxes are not being highlighted on `GitHub`. That happens because the [Linguist Project](https://github.com/github/linguist) targets only the main existent programming languages.

Because of that, most of the time it is annoying to see a new-or-unknown-language source code. That is to say, `Linguist Unknown` helps new, lost or unknown languages to be visualized on GitHub. You _should_ probably have this extension in order to augment the number of highlighted languages on your GitHub.

### How can I download and use it?
__Two Simple Steps__:
- Install the [Google Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linguist-unknown/oohlobhfikieeeldgalkkkaojcaebclk).
- Make sure it is active.

### Why Should I add my language?
Having your programming language listed/highlighted by GitHub is not always as easy when your programming language has not been largely used yet. Thus, adding your language to this repository will help you to do what you already do on your favorite Text Editor.

This project is meant to be a `Highlighter` of `Preview` for GitHub Unknown Languages.
